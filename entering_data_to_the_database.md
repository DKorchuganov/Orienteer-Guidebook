# Entering Data to the Database

##Entering and viewing data

To browse class's documents, go to the **Schema** page (URL */schema*) and on the line of the needed class, click **Browse Class**. 

>** Tip!** By [managing perspectives](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/managing_users.html), you can make a separate button on the navigation pane for quick access to a needed class

In the class's document list, you can edit documents and enter new documents to your database.

By [adding widgets](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/orienteer_user_interface.html) to this page, you can also visualize data.

##Data visualization
On each page, you can see a set of panes displaying data. For example, by default, editing a class, you can see panes **Configuration**, **Properties** etc. These panes are widgets, and for each page, you can customize your work space by adding and configuring widgets. 

* To add a widget, on the top right of the top widget, click ![](UI-adding-widgets.jpg). Choose and configure a widget and then click **Save**.
* To configure widget, on its top right click **Actions**.

Different kinds of pages allow for different sets of widgets. 

>**Tip!** A list of documents allows you to add a pivot table, which can graphically represent data as a table, a chart etc.
