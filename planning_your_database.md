# Planning Your Database

Before you start building your schema, we recommend that you plan your data model beforehand. For example, you can first draw your data model in a UML diagram. Later  you will create classes in a schema, set their properties and connections. This will be easier for you to make if you refer to a data model diagram.

>**Tip!** After you build your model, you can build a UML diagram for the classes that you created and compare them with your plan. This will give you an extra verification.
