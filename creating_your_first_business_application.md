# Creating Your First Business Application

It's time to create your business application. 

This chapter will walk you through Orienteer configuration basics. We will build a basic CRM app that stores client names, contacts (like email, skype etc.) and the type of their interaction with the company (namely: interested, purchase, support). 

We will go through steps to create a minimal viable app. Advanced settings are available for you in next chapters.


> Note. This chapter shows configurations in the default Orienteer perspective.
