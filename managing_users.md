# Managing Users and their Access

You can manage roles and assign them to particular users.

##Managing roles

A role determines what operations a user can perform against a resource.
To view the **Roles**, on the navigation pane, click **Roles**. When you create a role, you can make it inherit from another role.

To edit all properties of a role, click its name. You will see a page of a particular role. 

On the **Properties** tab:
* The role's **Name** 
* **Mode** for ...
* **Inherited Role** sets the parent role from which the role will inherit its parameters.
* **Rules** 
This will ask you the string of the resource that you want to secure. For a list of available resources, visit the official documentation
