# Developing The Data Model

In this section, we build a simple data model and augment it, step by step.

## Creating a Class

---
 This part will guide you through creating a class, setting its properties and creating an instance of the new class (a document) in Orienteer.

---

We will start with the simplest model, with only one class, *CmsCustomer*. It will have properties *Customer name*, *Contacts* and *Interaction*.

1. Go to page */schema*.
2. To create a new class, —Ålick **Create**.
3. On the class page, set `Name: CmsCustomer` and click **Save**.
4. On the widget *Properties* create three properties by clicking **Create**. Set their  parameters:
  * For the *customerName* property, set `Name: customerName`, `Type: String`.
  * For the *contact* property, set `Name: contact`, `Type: String`.
  * For the *interaction* property, set `Name: interaction`, `Type: String`.
 
 Then  click **Save**.
5. Specify which of the parameters will identify a document. In our case each document corresponds to a customer's name. So, in the class *CmsCustomer*, on the widget *Configuration*, set `Document Name Property: customerName`.

Now we can create documents of the class *CmsCustomer*. Each document corresponds to a person.

Once we want to add or edit a  customer, we  go to the list of class's documents.
1. Go to */browse/CmsCustomer* (otherwise, on the */schema* page, in the line *CmsCustomer*, on the right, click **Browse Class**).
2. To create a new document, click **Create**.
3. Now you can fill new client's data and save it.

## Linking Classes, Managing Property Visualization

---
This part will guide you through linking classes in Orienteer. You will also learn how to display properties on separate tabs and how to enable basic UI controls to manage properties of a document.

---

In the app we've just created, we store all contacts in a single plaintext field for skype, telephones, emails etc in bulk. Now we want each customer to have several separate contact records, each containing one contact. We also  want contacts of each customer to show on a separate tab.

Do the following:
1. From the class *CmsCustomer*, delete the property *contact*. We will store contacts in a different way. 
2. Create a new class for storing contacts, *CmsContact*

  We want each customer's contact to be stored as a separate item. This is why we will create a separate class for contacts. We will be able to add as many documents of this class as needed to each customer.
  
3. Link the *CmsContact* and the *CmsCustomer* classes. For this, add special LINK properties to both classes:
  *  To the *CmsCustomer* class, add a property *linkToContacts* with parameters `Type: LINKLIST`, `Linked Class: CmsContact`.
  *  To the *CmsContact* class we add a property *Customer* with parameters:
    *  `Type: LINK`.
    *   `Linked Class: CmsCustomer`.
    *   `Visualization: listbox` (this will let the app user select a linked customer for a contact from a drop box).
    *  `Inverse: linkToContacts` (here you choose a back link from the list of link type parameters of the linked class, *CmsCustomer*).
  *  Go back to the *CmsCustomer* class and edit the parameter *linkToContact*. Set its parameter *Inverse* similarly, by selecting the property *Customer*.

4. We want each customer's contacts to show on a separate tab. For this, in the class *CmsCustomer* edit the link property *linkToContacts*. Set the following parameters:
  * `Tab: Contacts`. Now a separate tab named *Contacts* will show the list of contacts linked to the particular customer.
  * `Visualization: table`. This enables UI elements like **Create** or **Save** buttons etc, that will be helpful to app users for creating and managing contacts.

5. In the previous step, we have changed the visualization of a property. When we look through the list of customers (the documents of the class *CmsCustomer* on the page */browse/CmsCustomer*), this property, with its buttons and other elements, is not useful. We will hide it from the document list.
   
   To do this, for each property of the class *CmsCustomer* set its parameter *Displayable*. Check it for the properties *customerName* and *interaction* and uncheck it for the property *linkToContacts*.

With this, we are done for this part. Now, when you create a customer, you do not give its contacts, only their name and stage of interaction. To add contacts, you will go to each customer's page and, on a separate tab *Contacts*, add as many contacts as you need.

## Viewing the UML of the Data Model


---
 This part will help you to view the UML of your data model in Orienteer.

---

Now we have several classes implemented, and we can view them all on an UML diagram.

To do this, on the schema page (*/schema*), check the classes *CmsCustomer* and *CmsContact*. Then click **View UML**. You will see the two classes with their links and properties on a UML diagram.

## Making a Property Selectable from a List

---
 This part will help you to make a property with values selectable from a list.

---

Now we can make several contats for a client. But if we would like to index them, we would face the fact that the app operators type in the data in every  possible style. Just think, how many ways are there to write the word "email"?

So, for each contact, we want the operators to select the contact type (email, skype etc) from a drop box with a pre-defined set of values.

For this, we create a class *CmsContactType*. This class will contain three instances (documents) that will represent the allowed contact types.

1. Create the class *CmsContactType* with just a single STRING type property, *contactTypeName*.
2. In this class, create four documents: 
  * *email* 
  * *skype*
  * *snail mail*
  * *telephone* 
3. In the class *CmsContact*, add a property *ContactType* with following parameters:
  * `Type: LINK`.
  * `Visualization: listbox` (this will let the user select the type of contact from a drop box).
  * `Linked Class: CmsContactType`.

Now you can check any customer's contacts. When you add a new contact or edit an existing one, you will have a drop box to select from a pre-defined set of values.

Let's check the new UML:

## Deriving Classes

---
 This part will guide you through deriving subclasses from a parent class in Orienteer.

---

So far, we store information about interaction with each customer in a string record. This record is voluntarily filled by the CMS operator. We want there to be just three pre-defined types of interaction: purchase, return, support. Each type will have a timestamp and a description, but these three types will differ in additional parameters. So, this is natural to create an abstract class *Interacton* with common properties and three derived subclasses.

Steps to go:
1. Create a class *CmsInteraction*. In its parameters, check the box *Abstract*.
2. For the class *CmsInteraction*, create properties:
  * *customer*: set `Type: LINK`, `Linked Class: CmsCustomer`.
  * *timestamp*: set `Type: DATETIME`.
3. On the page of the *CmsInteraction* class, go to the tab *Subclasses*. Do the following:
  * Create the derived class *CmsPurchase*:
    * On the *Properties* widget, click **Save** to confirm the inherited properties.
    * Create the class-specific string property *products* that will store the list of purchased products.
  * Derive the class *CmsReturn* with specific string properties *returnProducts* and *claimReason*.
  * Derive the class *CmsSupport* with the specific string property *chatHistory*.

4. In the class *CmsCustomer*, we already have the string-type property *interaction*, but we want it to be link-type. Delete the property *interaction* and create a new property with similar name. Set its parameters `Type: LINKLIST`, `Visualization: table`, `Linked Class: CmsInteraction`, `Inverse: customer`.
5. For the class *CmsInteraction*, for the property *customer* set `Inverse: interaction`.
6. Let us also have interactions for each customer on a separate tab. For the class *CmsCustomer*, for the parameter *interactions*, set `Tab: Interactions`.

Now we  can log our interactions with clients on a separate tab. Let's view the new UML.

## Calculable Properties

---
This part will show you an example of using calculable properties in Orienteer.

---

For each customer, we have a separate tab with his interactions. The interactions are presented as a table. Let's add a calculable property *"new_interaction"* that will flag interactions that are more than 1 month old.

To do this, in the abstract class CmsInteraction, create a property *new_interaction* with parameters: `Type: string`, `Calculable: yes`, `Script: ...`

## Localizing a Class
