# Developing The Data Model

In this section, we build a simple data model and augment it, step by step.

We will build a basic CRM app that stores client names, contacts (like email, skype etc.) and the type of their interaction with the company (namely: interested, purchase, support). 

We will go through steps to create a minimal viable app. Advanced settings are available for you in next chapters.
