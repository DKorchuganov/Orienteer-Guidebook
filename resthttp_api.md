# REST/HTTP API

Orienteer HTTP API is based on the OrientDB HTTP API approach (see http://orientdb.com/docs/last/OrientDB-REST.html).

**[THE FURTHER PART OF THIS SECTION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT]**

OrientdB REST is available under the path /orientdb/ (we need a few URL examples in a table).
For example: http://demo.orienteer.org/orientdb/document/db/5:0
