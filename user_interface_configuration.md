# User Interface Configuration

Orienteer provides adaptive UI, making Orienteer apps available on mobile devices.

##Allocating Perspectives to User Roles

The administrator allocates perspectives available for each user role.

To configure perspectives, on the navigation pane, click **Perspectives** (URL: *&lt;databaseURL&gt; /browse/OPerspective*).

For each perspective, you can add sections to the navigation pane. Sections have following attributes:
* **Name** is the name of the section that will show on the navigation pane.
* **Icon** is the icon that will show on the navigation pane by the section's name. You can set the icon by ...
* **Home Url** sets the page that will show when you click the section.
* **Sub items** ...
* **Footer** ...

> **Warning!** If users don't see a page in their perspective, this doesn't prevent them from accessing a page over its URL. To restrict the access, configure the [database security settings].

##Adding Widgets
On each page, the administrator can see a set of widgets displaying data. For example, by default, editing a class, you can see panes **Configuration**, **Properties** etc. The administrator can customize each page by adding and configuring widgets. 

* To add a widget, on the top right of the top widget, click ![](UI-adding-widgets.jpg). Choose and configure a widget and then click **Save**.
* To configure widget, on its top right click **Actions**.

Different kinds of pages allow for different sets of widgets. 

>**Tip!** A list of documents allows you to add a pivot table, which can graphically represent data as a table, a chart etc.
