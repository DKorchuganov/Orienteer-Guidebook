The data model is heart of any application. It defines entities and their relationship in the app universe. The data model should be flexible enough to provide consistent reflection of use cases.

You can manage data model on the *Schema* page (*/schema*).

Orienteer is a graph + document type of database, so, properties of a class may have links (references to other documents) as their attributes.
