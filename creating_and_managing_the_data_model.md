# The Data Model

You implement you data model by creating classes and setting their properties. You can work with classes on the **Schema** page ([..]/schema), on the **Classes** tab.
*  Orienteer supports inheritance between classes, so, a class may have a parent class.
*  Orienteer is a graph + document type of database, so, properties of a class may contain links (references to other documents).
