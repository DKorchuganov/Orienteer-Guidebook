## Data model, configurations etc
**Q: What do you call a document? **

A: A document is an object of a class. 

**Q: Ð¡an I attach an arbitrary file to a document?**

A: Yes. In the class of the document, you need to specify a parameter of type BINARY. You will then be able to attach a file as this parameter to a document. This file will be downloadable from the document.

If this file will be a picture, you can show its thumbnail in the document. For this, in the BINARY parameter's settings specify its visualization: Image.

**Q: Can I implement actions that will work when a document fits to some criteria? For instance, when some property of a document takes a value within some range?**

A: Yes. For this, you will use hooks (triggers), by deriving from the OTriggered class. They may trigger  any automatic actions, from screen notifications or emails to making outomatic records to a log. For details, [see OrientDB guide](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Dynamic-Hooks.html).

**Q: Similarly, can Orienteer do specific actions on coincidences of data from many properties of many documents? For example, identifying statistical outlyers.**

A: Yes. Similarly, this will require using hooks (triggers) by deriving from the OTriggered class. For details, [see OrientDB guide](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Dynamic-Hooks.html).

##Users and User Rights

**Q: Can I make rights of users to read / write documents dependent on values of particular properties? E.g. I would like to make documents marked *for audit* visible for the *Auditor* role**

A: Yes. There are two main ways for that:

* If a class extends the *OTriggered* class, you can set it to call the event *onAfterRead* that will check user rights. For details, see [OrientDB guide](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Dynamic-Hooks.html).
* For providing higher performance, you can implement a java hook with the *ORecordHook* interface, which would check credentials of the user that works with data. For details, see [OrientDB guide](http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Java-Hooks.html).

**Q: How can I add company departments as groups of users to manage them in joint? **

A: It's recommended to user Orienteer roles for modeling of company departments.

 ##Logging
 
**Q: How can data changes be logged?**

A: See http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Auditing.html

**Q: How can I delete a class but leave its documents in the database for auditing and history logs? Can I hide it and prevent it from being used?**
 
...
