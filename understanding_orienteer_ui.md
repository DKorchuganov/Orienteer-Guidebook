# Understanding Orienteer UI

The Orienteer UI is based on several basic concepts.

## Pages and perspectives
An Orienteer app is displayed for users as a set of **pages**. Some pages may be universal for all Orienteer apps, like *Users* or *Classes*. Others may be specific to particular apps. Users can access pages by links (e.g. on the navigation pane) or [via their URLs](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/special_urls.html).

A **perspective** defines what pages are available for the user on the navigation pane and what is the default page that a user sees after logging in. 

Example (the default perspective):

For each user role, the Orienteer app administrator allocates a set of available perspectives to select from, one of which is the default. When a user logs in, he views the default perspective. To select another perspective, the user will need to click ![](UI-selecting-perspectives.jpg) on the top right.

## Tabs
The administrator can set each page to display a given set of tabs. 

## Widgets
The administrator can set each page or a tab to display a particular set of **widgets**. Widgets may display a variety of data, including tables, graphs and custom widgets developed for a particular app.
Example: the default set of widgets on a page of a class includes widgets Configuration, Properties, Indexes, Custom properties.
