# Understanding Orienteer UI

The Orienteer UI is based on several basic concepts.

## Pages and perspectives
An Orienteer app is displayed for users as a set of **pages**. Some pages may be universal for all Orienteer apps, like *Users* or *Classes*. Others may be specific to particular apps. Users can access pages by links (e.g. on the navigation pane) or [via their URLs](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/special_urls.html).

A **perspective** defines what pages are available for the user on the navigation pane and what is the default page that a user sees after logging in. 

Example (the default perspective):

Each user role has a [set of available perspectives](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/orienteer_user_interface.html) to select from, one of which is default. When a user logs in, he views the default perspective. To select another perspective, the user will need to click ![](UI-selecting-perspectives.jpg) on the top right.
