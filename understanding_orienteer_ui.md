# Understanding Orienteer UI

The Orienteer UI is based on several basic concepts.

## Perspectives
A perspective defines what page a user sees after logging in and what pages are available for him or her on the navigation pane. Each user role has a [set of available perspectives](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/orienteer_user_interface.html) to select from.

When you log in, you view the default perspective defined for your [role](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/managing_users.html). 
To select another perspective available for your role, on the top right, click ![](UI-selecting-perspectives.jpg).
