# Understanding Orienteer UI

The Orienteer UI is based on several basic concepts.

## Perspectives
A perspective defines what pages are available for the user on the navigation pane and what is the default page that a user sees after logging in. 

Each user role has a [set of available perspectives](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/orienteer_user_interface.html) to select from. One of them is the default perspective for this user role.

When a user logs in, he views the default perspective defined for his [role](https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/managing_users.html). To select another perspective available for your role, on the top right, click ![](UI-selecting-perspectives.jpg).
