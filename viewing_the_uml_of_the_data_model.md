# Viewing the UML of the Data Model


---
 This part will help you to view the UML of your data model in Orienteer.

---

Now we have several classes implemented, and we can view them all on an UML diagram.

To do this, on the schema page (*/schema*), check the classes *CmsCustomer* and *CmsContact*. Then click **View UML**. You will see the two classes with their links and properties on a UML diagram.
