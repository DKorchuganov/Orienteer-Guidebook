# Triggers

Triggers (hooks) intercept CRUD operations in the database and call a function or a method. This is very useful, when you want to enable automatic verification of data or security rules. You can create class-level and document-level triggers. They will work, respectively, for any document of a class or for specific documents. 

To read more about triggers in OrientDB, see http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Hook.html.

To create a trigger, derive a class from the abstract class OTriggered.
